**definitions**
> *Random Experiment*: An "experiment" ( the term is used lightly) whose outcomes are uncertain <br/>
> *Sample Space* The set of all possible outcomes of the random experiment typically denoted by $\Omega $ or $S$ <br/>

example 1:
The result of a coin tossed twice
$\Omega = \{ HH,HT,TH,TT\}$
> *Events* for the purposes of this courses, an event is a subset of $\Omega$ <br/>

on example 1, A = "at least one head" is an event and $A= \{ HH,HT,TH\}$
